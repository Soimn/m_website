title: About the Project
$

The M language project was started by [Simon Doksr√∏d](https://github.com/Soimn) in 2022 as an effort to take step back from the rat's nest of complexity that modern software has become. The goal of the project is to improve the situation by providing a language that builds upon the foundation of today's languages, and takes one step in the right direction.
