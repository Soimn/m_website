title: The M Language
$

Software is currently in a sad state, with a normal commerical product consisting of hundreds of dependencies and countless more bugs and security holes. The M language project is an effort to take one step away from this, and hopefully towards a better future.


The language aims to be an alternative to C for procedural systems programming on modern machines, taking heavy 'inspiration' from languages such as [Jai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ&list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO) and [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), with the following notable bullet points:
<ul>
	<li>no undefined behaviour</li>
	<li>no language runtime</li>
	<li>one compiler</li>
	<li>one standard library</li>
</ul>
