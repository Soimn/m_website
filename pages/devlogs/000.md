title: The First Devlog
date: 2022.03.19

The title of this devlog may be a bit decieving, as this log was not written before starting, or anywhere near the start of, the project. This iteration of the project began in November of 2021, and the compiler for the language has been completed up to, but not including, iterative type checking. The reason I say 'this' iteration, is that project has been rebooted countless times since the first iteration in 2019, and is going undergo another reboot during this devlog. So, in a sense, this is the last devlog for the previous iteration, as well as the first for the new iteration.


## What even is a programming language?
Before starting to work on the new revision of the project, it would be wise to take a step back, and evaluate if any of the decisions made make actual sense or not. Included in those decisions are the assumptions I make about and paradigms I subscribe to regarding programming languages.
