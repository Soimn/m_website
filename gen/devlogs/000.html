<h1 id="title">The First Devlog</h1>
<p id="date">2022.03.20</p>
The title of this devlog may be a bit deceiving, as this log was not written before starting, or anywhere near the start of, the project. This iteration of the project began in November 2021, and the compiler for the language has been completed up to, but not including, iterative type checking. The reason I say 'this' iteration, is that the project has been rebooted countless times since the first iteration in 2019, and is going to undergo another reboot during this devlog. So, in a sense, this is the last devlog for the previous iteration, as well as the first for the new iteration.

<br>
<br><h3>Project history and Approach
</h3>The set of goals has varied for each iteration, some more than others. At first, the main goal was to create a C compiler with metaprogramming capabilities similar to Jai. This proved out to be difficult, as parsing C is a horrible experience, and modifying its grammar to support multiple return values, type inference and other shenanigans made it way worse. Some later iteration scrapped the C syntax, in favor of a syntax similar to Odin/Jai, and then the main goal was to make metaprogramming maximally powerful. This, in my mind, implied that the language should be made as simple as possible, such that metaprogramming only had to deal with its own complexity, and not some arbitrary cruft in the language design. However, this ended up getting out of hand, making the language concepts deviate too much from what actually runs on hardware. The next iteration then focused on making every decision grounded in reality, by examining a selection of target systems, and trying to construct a common model. From the selection of hardware I made, this became a rat's nest of complexity. Trying to learn from my mistakes, the last iteration made focused on making a simple bare-bones prototype of something I thought would work, and then evaluating and iterating upon that prototype. This is kind of the most obvious tactic to solving a problem, since you never truly know how it should be solved before actually solving it. I always knew this, but I kept thinking I wanted to avoid the common mistake in software of making something that seems to work, and then bunching on a ton of complexity to handle new features and fix bugs. The way I thought was the correct way of avoiding this was to thoroughly examine the problem and design everything neatly to solve that specific problem. However, as previously stated, you never truly know how a problem should be solved before actually solving it, which ended biting me hard. I kept on wasting way too much time on planning, afraid of writing something ad hoc that works, since it might not be the optimal solution I was looking for. Which is kind of weird, since I am not afraid of rewriting everything, as I have countless times (in total I have pushed 89 thousand lines of code to github, and removed 76 thousand, over the course of three iterations). What I should have learned is that the problem of tacking on complexity and making a mess, doesn't come from not planning enough, it comes from not discarding prototypes, and building upon them instead. Since I am clearly not afraid of scrapping everything, as opposed to some project manager in a company, I should leverage this, and stop "overplanning". The next iteration of the project will therefore prioritize making quick prototypes, instead of simulating a design committee with choice paralysis.

<br><h3>Motivation and Goals
</h3>Now that the general development approach has been decided, what is it that I will be making? This seems like a weird question, since this is clearly a project devoted to making a programming language and compiler. However, making a programming language is not a very specific goal, as it leaves a bunch of questions like is it compiled or interpreted, is it object oriented or maybe functional, and generally what is actually accomplished by making yet another random programming language? To answer some of these questions, I will be taking a step back and evaluate what a programming language should be, what I want to accomplish by making one and what a programming language even is to begin with.</div>
